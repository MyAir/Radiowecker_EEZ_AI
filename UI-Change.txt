**UI Change Instructions for EEZ Studio (Revision 8 - Simplification Test):**

**Goal:** Determine if the complexity of the `AlarmEntry` widget is the cause of the stack overflow crash.

**Observation:** You have successfully removed the pop-up keyboard and calendar, but the crash persists. The error is a "Stack canary watchpoint," which indicates a stack overflow. This is very likely caused by LVGL's layout system going into a deep recursion when trying to calculate the size and position of the many nested objects inside your `AlarmEntry` widget.

**Solution:** We will perform a test by temporarily replacing the complex `AlarmEntry` with a very simple placeholder. If the crash stops, it proves the complexity is the root cause.

**Please perform the following steps in EEZ Studio:**

**1. Create a *New* Simple User Widget:**
   - Create a new User Widget named `AlarmEntrySimple`.
   - Inside this new widget, add only **one** object: a basic **Container**.
   - Select this container and set its properties:
     - **Size Panel:** `Width: 100%`, `Height: 50px` (a fixed, small height).
     - **Style Panel:** Give it a visible background color (e.g., blue) so we can see it.
   - You can add a simple Label inside it saying "Test" if you like.

**2. Replace `AlarmEntry` on the Alarms Screen:**
   - Go to your `Alarms` screen in the editor.
   - Delete the three instances of the original `AlarmEntry` widget from your list (`alarms_panel`).
   - Drag three instances of your new `AlarmEntrySimple` widget into the list.

**3. Regenerate and Test:**
   - Save the project and **regenerate the UI files**.
   - Build and upload the new code to your device.
   - Navigate to the Alarms screen.

**Expected Outcome:**
The Alarms screen should now display three simple blue boxes without crashing.

If this test is successful, it confirms the `AlarmEntry` layout needs to be rebuilt with fewer nested containers. We can then work on a more efficient layout.
