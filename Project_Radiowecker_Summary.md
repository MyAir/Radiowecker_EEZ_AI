# Project Radiowecker: ESP32 Alarm Clock - Conversation Summary

This document summarizes the development and debugging process for the ESP32-S3 Alarm Clock project to facilitate moving the conversation to a new environment.

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective is to implement the C++ backend logic for an ESP32-based alarm clock. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) designed in EEZ Studio and rendered with the LVGL library. The backend is responsible for dynamically managing alarms (add, edit, delete), storing them in a JSON file on an SD card, and seamlessly integrating with the EEZ Studio-generated UI and event flow.

## 2. Hardware and Software Stack

### Hardware
- **Display Module:** Makerfabs MaTouch_ESP32-S3 Parallel TFT with Touch 4.3" (v3.1)
- **Controller:** ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 (16MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM)
- **Touch Driver:** GT911 (Capacitive)
- **Sensors (I2C):** SGP30 (TVOC/eCO2) & SHT31 (Temp/Humidity)
- **Sensors (GPIO):** Mabee Light Sensor

### Software
- **Framework:** PlatformIO with Arduino
- **UI Library:** LVGL 9.2.2
- **Graphics Driver:** lovyan03/LovyanGFX @ ^1.2.7
- **Core Libraries:** ArduinoJson, ESP8266Audio, Adafruit SGP30, Adafruit SHT31

## 3. Key Architectural Decisions & Findings

- **UI/Backend Separation:** A strict separation is maintained between the UI layout/flow (managed by EEZ Studio and located in `/lib/ui`) and the C++ application logic (`AlarmManager`, `main.cpp`, etc.).
- **Dynamic UI Population:** The alarm list on the main screen is not static. It is populated dynamically at runtime by reading from `/alarms.json` on the SD card.
- **`AlarmManager` Singleton:** A singleton class, `AlarmManager`, serves as the central point for all alarm-related logic, including loading, saving, editing, and managing the selection state.
- **EEZ Flow for Navigation:** Screen transitions (e.g., opening the alarm edit screen) are handled by "Change Screen" actions configured within the EEZ Studio flow editor, not by manual calls to `lv_screen_load()` in the C++ code.
- **Stable Display Driver:** The display operates reliably using `LV_DISPLAY_RENDER_MODE_PARTIAL` with two buffers allocated in PSRAM. The `my_disp_flush` callback uses low-level LovyanGFX commands (`startWrite`, `setAddrWindow`, etc.) to prevent flickering and artifacts.
- **UI Helper Bridge:** A C-based helper file (`ui_helpers_extended.c`/`.h`) was created to act as a bridge, allowing the C++ `AlarmManager` to call UI functions that manipulate LVGL objects (which are C structs).

## 4. Summary of Work and Code Evolution

The project evolved through several key stages of implementation and debugging:

1.  **Initial Setup:** Configured the project with the correct hardware profile and libraries.
2.  **`AlarmManager` Implementation:**
    *   Created the `AlarmManager` class to handle the core logic.
    *   Implemented `loadAlarms()` and `saveAlarm()` using ArduinoJson to parse and write to `/alarms.json`.
    *   Added methods to manage the alarm lifecycle: `startAddAlarm()`, `startEditAlarm()`, `deleteAlarm()`, `setSelectedAlarm()`.
3.  **Dynamic List Population:**
    *   The `populateAlarmList()` method was implemented to clear the existing list and re-create it from the loaded alarms.
    *   It uses the `create_and_populate_alarm_widget` helper function to create each visual entry.
    *   An event handler, `alarm_entry_click_event_handler`, is attached to each entry. This handler uses `lv_event_get_user_data` to identify which alarm was clicked and updates the selection state.
4.  **Event Handler Integration in `main.cpp`:**
    *   Event handlers were created and registered for all interactive elements: Add, Edit, Delete, Save, and Cancel buttons.
    *   Logic was added to the `alarm_edit_screen_load_handler` to populate the edit screen with existing alarm data (for EDIT mode) or default values (for ADD mode).
    *   The `save_button_event_handler` collects data from the UI widgets, saves it via `AlarmManager`, and triggers a repopulation of the alarm list.
5.  **Intensive Debugging Cycle:**
    *   **File Path Correction:** Fixed initial file access errors by confirming the correct path is `/alarms.json` at the root of the SD card.
    *   **Compilation Errors:** Resolved a series of C++ compilation errors, including:
        *   Missing `static_cast` for `void*` to `lv_obj_t*` conversion.
        *   Redefinition of functions (`add_alarm_button_event_handler`).
        *   Incorrect event handler names in `setup()`.
        *   Missing includes (`screens.h` in `AlarmManager.cpp` to access UI objects).
        *   Syntax errors from misplaced code blocks.
    *   **Logic Refinement:** Corrected the logic for passing data to `create_and_populate_alarm_widget`, sending individual fields (title, hour, etc.) instead of a whole object.

## 5. Current Status & Next Steps

- **Build Status:** The code now **compiles, links, and uploads successfully** after fixing all known C++ errors.
- **Runtime Status:** The device is running the latest firmware. The serial monitor is active.
- **Identified Issue:** The log shows an **`I2C bus error detected (code 5)`**. This points to a potential problem with the SGP30/SHT31 sensor module. It's unclear if this is a fatal or recoverable error.
- **Next Steps:**
    1.  **Investigate the I2C Error:** Determine if the sensor data is being displayed correctly on the UI. If not, debug the I2C initialization and communication logic.
    2.  **Full Functional Test:** Thoroughly test the entire alarm management workflow on the device as planned:
        *   Verify alarm list population.
        *   Test alarm selection, highlighting, and Edit/Delete button enablement.
        *   Test the full Add, Edit, and Delete flows.
        *   Test the Save and Cancel functionality.
    3.  **Analyze Debug Output:** Continue monitoring the serial output for any further errors or unexpected behavior during the functional test.
